<p>I study why bacteria live where they do, what they are doing there, how they <br />
interact with each other, and how they change over time. Bacteria live everywhere we can imagine, <br />
and they often exhibit biogeography (patterns of certain bacteria appearing in certain places) across <br />
many different scales - some bacteria live only next to certain other bacteria (the micron <br />
scale), others live in certain regions of the human body but not others (centimeter scales), <br />
others might live at hydrothermal vents separated by hundreds of kilmeters.</p>

<p>For those who think about human health, biogeography is especially important. Many microbe-<br />
associated medical problems (think <em>Staph. aureus</em> infections) are essentially the right microbe<br />
in the wrong place. Figuring out what keeps the right microbes in the right places in healthy<br />
people is critical for medical professionals to be able to keep microbes where theyâ€™re supposed<br />
to be to keep us healthy. And understanding how microbes change over time in healthy populations <br />
is essential for us to be able to distinguish between change for the better or for the worse.</p>

<h2 id="thesis-projects">Thesis projects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How different are strains of a given bacterial species? - [<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.072496v1">preprint</a>]  [<a href="/projects/oral_metapan">methods</a>]
    <ul>
      <li>Bacteria in the human oral microbiome exhibit striking biogeography despite salivary mixing</li>
      <li>We compared the genomes of many cultured strains to compare their differences, and <br />
detect patterns about where they lived, and found some exciting clues about what genes <br />
underpin their biogeography</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How do oral bacterial populations change over time? - [in preparation]
    <ul>
      <li>The oral microbiome is a dynamic place, and so are bacterial populations</li>
      <li>We wanted to study how bacterial populations typically evolve over short timescales, <br />
specifically whether they changed gene-by-gene, or or by whole genomes or pre-existing <br />
subpopulations (a.k.a ecotypes) that swept a whole genomeâ€™s worth of genes to abundance</li>
      <li>For this, we collected metagenomes at intervals of days to weeks from several volunteers, <br />
and analzed the metagenomes to resolve populations, population variants, and genes, and <br />
track them over time to study evolution as a dynamic process in a natural setting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Genomics of individual-specific populations in the human oral microbiome [in preparation]
    <ul>
      <li>The oral microbiome has <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00564/full">generally stable composition with small inter-personal variations</a>.</li>
      <li>We are interested in studying the genetic basis of individuality to assess the ecological significance (if any) of these similar-but-distinct populations.</li>
    </ul>

<ul>
  <li>TM7x host range - <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-020-00736-6">published</a>  <a href="/projects/Act23_phylo">methods</a>
    <ul>
      <li>TM7x is an obligate bacterial symbiont that lives off of other bacteria, first isolated from the <br />
healthy human oral cavity. Usually, TM7x is considered a parasite becuase <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/48/12277#F2">impedes host growth in the lab</a>.</li>
      <li>Working with <a href="https://www.forsyth.org/scientists/batbileg-bor/">Bat Bor</a>, who found that not all hosts were affected as strongly, we found that the <br />
minimally-affected hosts formed a tight phylogenetic subgroup. We associated a number of genes, <br />
including cell envelope and metabolic functions, with the  different TM7x response types, for future experimental work to confirm.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>Toxin evolution in <em>Proteus mirabilis</em> - <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.956912v1.full">preprint</a>  <a href="/projects/idrD_narrative">methods</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Bacteria have elaborate ways to identify kin and impede non-kin neightbors, including contact-dependent<br />
toxins they deploy into toxins.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.gibbslab.org/home">Gibbs lab</a>, among other topics, studies this in <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and part of <br />
<a href="">Denise Siriasâ€™s</a> PhD research included identifying and characterizing a novel nuclease toxin.</li>
      <li>After Deniseâ€™s terrific molecular work to identified the domains of required for enzymatic activity, we collaborated to characterize the toxinâ€™s representation in the global human metagenome and discovered how inter- and <br />
intra-species variability within metagenomes tracked domain function.</li>
