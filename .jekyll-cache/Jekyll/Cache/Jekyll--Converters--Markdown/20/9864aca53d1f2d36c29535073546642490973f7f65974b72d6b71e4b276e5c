<p>I study why bacteria live where they do, what they are doing there, how they interact with each other, and how they change over time. Bacteria live everywhere we can imagine, and they often exhibit biogeography (patterns of certain bacteria appearing in certain places) across many different scales - some bacteria live only next to certain other bacteria (the micron scale), others live in certain regions of the human body but not others (centimeter scales), others might live at hydrothermal vents separated by hundreds of kilmeters.</p>

<p>For those who think about human health, biogeography is especially important. Many microbe-associated medical problems (think <em>Staph. aureus</em> infections) are essentially the right microbe in the wrong place. Figuring out what keeps the right microbes in the right places in healthy people is critical for medical professionals to be able to keep microbes where they’re supposed to be to keep us healthy. And understanding how microbes change over time in healthy populations is essential for us to be able to distinguish between change for the better or for the worse.</p>

<h2 id="thesis-projects">Thesis projects:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How different are strains of a given bacterial species? - [<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.072496v1">preprint</a>]  [<a href="/projects/oral_metapan">methods</a>]
    <ul>
      <li>Bacteria in the human oral microbiome exhibit striking biogeography despite salivary mixing</li>
      <li>We compared the genomes of many cultured strains to compare their differences, and 
detect patterns about where they lived, and found some exciting clues about what genes 
underpin their biogeography</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How do oral bacterial populations change over time? - [in preparation]
    <ul>
      <li>The oral microbiome is a dynamic place, and so are bacterial populations</li>
      <li>We wanted to study how bacterial populations typically evolve over short timescales, 
specifically whether they changed gene-by-gene, or or by whole genomes or pre-existing 
subpopulations (a.k.a ecotypes) that swept a whole genome’s worth of genes to abundance</li>
      <li>For this, we collected metagenomes at intervals of days to weeks from several volunteers, 
and analzed the metagenomes to resolve populations, population variants, and genes, and 
track them over time to study evolution as a dynamic process in a natural setting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Genomics of individual-specific populations in the human oral microbiome [in preparation]
    <ul>
      <li>The oral microbiome has <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00564/full">generally stable composition with small inter-personal variations</a>.</li>
      <li>We are interested in studying the genetic basis of individuality to assess the ecological significance (if any) of these similar-but-distinct populations.</li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="as-collaborations">As collaborations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>TM7x host range - [<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-020-00736-6">article</a>]  [<a href="/projects/Act23_phylo">methods</a>]
    <ul>
      <li>TM7x is an obligate bacterial symbiont that lives off of other bacteria, first isolated from the 
healthy human oral cavity. Usually, TM7x is considered a parasite becuase <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/48/12277#F2">impedes host growth in the lab</a>.</li>
      <li>Working with <a href="https://www.forsyth.org/scientists/batbileg-bor/">Bat Bor</a>, who found that not all hosts were affected as strongly, we found that the 
minimally-affected hosts formed a tight phylogenetic subgroup. We associated a number of genes, 
including cell envelope and metabolic functions, with the  different TM7x response types, for future experimental work to confirm.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Toxin evolution in <em>Proteus mirabilis</em> - <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.956912v1.full">preprint</a>  <a href="/projects/idrD_narrative">methods</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Bacteria have elaborate ways to identify kin and impede non-kin neightbors, including contact-dependent<br />
toxins they deploy into toxins.</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.gibbslab.org/home">Gibbs lab</a>, among other topics, studies this in <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, and part of <a href="">Dr. Denise Sirias’s</a> PhD research included identifying and characterizing a novel nuclease toxin.</li>
      <li>After Denise’s terrific molecular work to identified the domains of required for enzymatic activity, we collaborated to characterize the toxin’s representation in the global human metagenome and discovered how inter- and intra-species variability within metagenomes tracked domain function.</li>
