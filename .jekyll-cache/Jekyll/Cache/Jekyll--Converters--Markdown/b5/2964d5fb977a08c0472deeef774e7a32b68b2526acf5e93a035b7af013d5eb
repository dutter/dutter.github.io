<p>Broadly, I study why bacteria live where they do, what they are doing there, how they <br />
interact with each other, and how they change over time. Bacteria live everywhere we can imagine, <br />
and they often exhibit biogeography (patterns of certain bacteria appearing in certain places) across <br />
many different scales - some bacteria live only next to certain other bacteria (the micron <br />
scale), others live in certain regions of the human body but not others (centimeter scales), <br />
others might live at hydrothermal vents separated by hundreds of kilmeters.</p>

<p>For those who think about human health, biogeography is especially important. Many microbe-<br />
associated medical problems (think <em>Staph. aureus</em> infections) are essentially the right microbe<br />
in the wrong place. Figuring out what keeps the right microbes in the right places in healthy<br />
people is critical for medical professionals to be able to keep microbes where theyâ€™re supposed<br />
to be to keep us healthy. And understanding how microbes change over time in healthy populations <br />
is essential for us to be able to distinguish between change for the better or for the worse.</p>

<h2 id="led-by-me">Led by me:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How different are strains of a given bacterial species? - <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.01.072496v1">preprint</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Bacteria in the human oral microbiome exhibit striking biogeography despite salivary mixing</li>
      <li>We compared the genomes of many cultured strains to compare their differences, and <br />
detect patterns about where they lived, and found some exciting clues about what genes <br />
underpin their biogeography</li>
      <li>The complete bioinformatics workflow can be found <a href="/projects/oral_metapan">here</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How do oral bacterial populations change over time? - in preparation
    <ul>
      <li>The oral microbiome is a dynamic place, and so are bacterial populations</li>
      <li>We wanted to study how bacterial populations typically evolve over short timescales, <br />
specifically whether they changed gene-by-gene, or or by whole genomes or pre-existing <br />
subpopulations (a.k.a ecotypes) that swept a whole genomeâ€™s worth of genes to abundance</li>
      <li>For this, we collected metagenomes at intervals of days to weeks from several volunteers, <br />
and analzed the metagenomes to resolve populations, population variants, and genes, and <br />
track them over time to study evolution as a dynamic process in a natural setting</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="in-collaboration-with-others">In collaboration with others:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>TM7x host range - manuscript <a href="">here</a>
    <ul>
      <li>TM7x is an obligate bacterial symbiont that lives off of other bacteria, first isolated<br />
from the healthy human oral cavity. Usually, TM7x is considered a parasite becuase its<br />
growth on its hosts <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/48/12277#F2">impedes their growth in the lab</a>.</li>
      <li>Working with <a href="https://www.forsyth.org/scientists/batbileg-bor/">Bat Bor</a>, who found that not all hosts were affected as strongly, we <br />
found that the minimally-affected hosts formed a tight phylogenetic subgroup. We associated<br />
a number of genes, including cell envelope and metabolic functions, with the <br />
different TM7x response types, for future experimental work to confirm.</li>
